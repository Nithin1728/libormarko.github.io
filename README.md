# A Personal Portfolio Webpage
This is my web development project. I built this personal portfolio webpage with front-end web development technologies. This site demonstrates the principles of responsive web design. The webpage has four main parts: About, Blog, Projects and Contact. Check the webpage [here](https://libormarko.github.io/) to find out more about me and my work. I wrote a blog post about the project, you can find it [here](https://medium.com/@marko.libor/my-personal-portfolio-webpage-d4c6913ff047).
